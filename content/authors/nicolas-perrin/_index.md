I am electronics hardware design engineer based in Paris France.
Since 2008, I designed a lot of different products including aeronotics equipments, led entertainment fixtures, USB and network storage devices, video real time mixing tools and automotive infotainment systems.
My passion is to create or enhance object. Of course, I like to take everything apart.
