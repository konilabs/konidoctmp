Hi everyone,

I work to redesign my personal website, which was close to clinical death.  
I will try to add more content by opening a blog section.

## Docs

[Docs](/docs) section contains document I use for my daily electronics hardware engineer job.  
It will be exclusively in english, because it is the hardware engineering language.  
I use theses documents for my work to do computation or to share data with partners.

## Blog

I will bring to life an old fashionned personnal blog.  
My goal is to write articles about technical topics, like machine repairing or interresting stuff I find when I browse the web.  
This part will be translated in french and in english, because there is few technical french content available on the Internet.

I wish you a nice tour on my website !

Nicolas
