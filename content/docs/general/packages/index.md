It is important to choose carefully chips packages, this allows to reduce PCBA size and also to reduce overall design cost.

## Passive

### Resistors

#### 0402

Maximum dissipated power : 60mW  
Which leads to :

- 430 Ohms over 5V
- 220 Ohms over 3.3V
- 51 Ohms over 1.8V

### Ceramic capacitors

#### 0402

Maximal value = 1µF with a maximum voltage of 6.3V

#### 0603

Maximal value = 10µF with a maximum voltage of 6.3V

#### 0805

Maximal value = 22µF with a maximum voltage of 16V
